					<h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
					<p>Four friends met each other whilst playing on a server in January 2021 and formed on that server the first ever Enderman Society. After playing on various servers together, three of the four decided to make their own server, and so The Enderman Society was born. With a passion for all things Enderman and an eternal love for the googly eyes.</p>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<i class="fa fa-user fa-4x"></i>
				<span>
					<h3>OUR STAFF</h3>
					<p>We have a dedicated network of staff who have been personally trained by the owners and therefore it is ensured that staff see eye to eye with the owners. Staff will always help out when a player is in need and all share the same goal: making a safe player environment and make sure everyone is having a great time!</p>
				</span>

				<span>
					<h3>OUR SERVER</h3>
					<p> We have a Semi Vanilla SMP server, which is inspired by a popular series on YouTube. We are seasons based, therefore after each season there is a map reset where we all start fresh with new ideas.</p>

					<h3>Shopping District</h3>
					<p> We have our very own shopping district where the currency is DIAMONDS. Here you can spend all your diamonds to your hearts content and get all the items you need to complete your builds! We have certain rules about how our shopping district functions, so keep an eye for those. Also, to prevent the economy to crash, we have established a minimum price for certain items in game.</p>

					<p align="left"><b>A:</b>Please do not make zero, or one tick farms. Two tick farms are allowed (ie, observer based) If you are not sure about your farm being laggy, message  staff in game if they are online or send us a Mod Mail, a member of staff will come and check your builds
					<p align="left"><b>B:</b>You may build your farms as you please, if it however creates massive lag on the server, we will warn you and ask you to either improve upon it or dismantle it.
					<p align="left"><b>C:</b>Entity cramming is not allowed on the server as a method of killing. Also methods of preventing entity cramming such as vines, ladders or trapdoors to increase the number of mobs or entities that can fit in a block. 
					<p align="left"><b>D:</b>Do not make any farms within a 250 block radius from spawn. Entity cramming is not allowed on the server.
					<p align="left"><b>E:</b>Skripts or clients that will not permit the staff to kick you in case of lag, are not allowed. If you have these installed you will be temporarily banned until you have removed these clients. This is in the probable case that your farms cause lag, that we can kick you so the overall player experience is better. 
					<p> 
					<p align="left">It is at the discretion of any of the staff members to kick you from the game without any previous warning if we decide that your farm is causing significant amount of lag. 
					<p>
					<p>
					<p>

				<p class="an-t">					
					<b>FAQ</b>
					<p align="left"><b>QUESTION:</b>What is the seed for the server?
					<p align="left"><b>ANSWER:</b>The seed is holy, and is not subject to release. the release of the seed will open up for the ability to find structures and other stuff without exploring, since exploring is an important part of the game, we would like to keep it that way by not sharing the seed
					<p align="left"><b>QEUSTION:</b>Is "keep inventory" on?
					<p align="left"><b>ANSWER:</b>Nope, keep inventory is not on.
					<p align="left"><b>QEUSTION:</b>Can we turn on keep inventory?
					<p align="left"><b>ANSWER:</b>No we are not going to turn on keep inventory. The majority of the player-base wishes to have it off, and it does in a way ruin the survival experience
					<p align="left"><b>QEUSTION:</b>Why haven't I been whitelisted? 
					<p align="left"><b>ANSWER:</b>Whitelisting can take up to 24h, you will get a DM if you have been accepted, you will also get a DM if you have been denied. Do not tag members of staff or DM staff, as this will qualify you for an immediate rejection!
